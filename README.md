# gof1

gof1 is a comprehensive Formula 1 data management tool built with Go, leveraging a SQLite3 database for storing and retrieving Formula 1 related data, including drivers, constructors, circuits, and race results. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) as well as a RESTful API powered by Gin for easy data manipulation and retrieval.
